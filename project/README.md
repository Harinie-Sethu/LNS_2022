#Language and Society: CS2.203 Project
#Comparitive Study between Todayâ€™s Korean and Tamil Languages, their Lexicon and Grammar

#Abstract
A genetic link between the Dravidian languages and Korean was first hypothesized by Homer B. Hulbert in 1905. Morgan E. Clippinger, a Korean studies scholar, gave a detailed comparison of Korean and Dravidian vocabulary in his article "Korean and Dravidian: Lexical Evidence for an Old Theory" (1984). He further proposed over 400 sets of similar words between the two languages. 

This is a study between the spoken languages of Korean and Tamil. It will verify the long-proposed link between the two languages by comparing the present-day spoken languages in Tamil Nadu (through native language speaker competence) and Korea (through Korean TV shows, popularly called K-drama). This project provides an opportunity to look further into these connections, to see if there are any social similarities, and a chance to explore why such a resemblance came into being.
